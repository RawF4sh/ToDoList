# Welcome to ToDoList!

ToDoList is a project that was created in one day during a short-form Hackathon, based on the very broad theme of "**positive impact**."

## What Is It?

ToDoList is a fully python-based schedule assistant that keeps track of your to-dos (known as tasks). Our main goal was to create something to help those that struggle with productivity or procrastination, by making an **easy-to-use** tracker that can keep track, show, and visualize your to-dos.

# Functions Available

ToDoList has multiple functions that work in tandem to make it work smoothly.

## Adding, Removing, and Completing Tasks

> Tasks can be edited at will through these three functions. When **making a task**, it will ask for a name for the task, as well as the due time you wish to set. **Removing tasks** will simply delete the task from the list, and will not set it as "complete." **Completing tasks** will remove the task from the to-do list, and will set it as "complete" in a different list.

## Showing Tasks as a List

> The fourth function is to list all the tasks from your to-do list in a list, as words. It will show the name of the task, as well as the due time of it. The order that the tasks appear in is connected to the order it was created in; they appear in descending order.

## Visualizing Tasks

> This function shows all completed and not completed tasks as a pie chart, with a legend on the side. Blue signifies tasks that are not completed; red signifies completed.
